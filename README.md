pygrnd
is a libary of various quantum algorithms written by the Team JoS QUANTUM GmbH to support the development of Applications for quantum computing in Finance, Insurance and Energy.

The Asset Allocator ist an example of how the problem is mathematically translated to a quadratic unconstrainted binary optimization ('QUBO'). This models is equivalent to the Ising model which can be mapped and solved by quantum annealer from e.g. D-Wave or variational quantum algorithms like VQE and QAOA.
